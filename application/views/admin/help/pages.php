<p>You can access your website pages from the dashboard quick links or from the main navigation. 
Pages are the bread and butter of your website. These are pages that you can add to the menus of your site.</p>

<p>The pages landing page shows a list of all of the pages on your site. From here you can add, edit, feature, unfeature, publish and unpublish any
page on your site.</p>

<h3>Adding & Editing A Page</h3>
<p>Adding and managing pages on your site is very easy. Techguy CMS uses a wysiwyg editor for editing and adding pages and posts. This allows
you to manage content using a Microsoft Word-Like interface. You can add text, images and videos through the editor.</p>

<h4>Fields & Options</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Page Name - The title of the page</li>
    <li>Page Body - The main text of the page. This field uses a wysiwyg editor with options such as font size, color, images and more. You can also use html tags in this area</li>
    <li>Page Modules - This is where you can select which modules you want to display on that current page. Some modules are "global" and those
    will show on the page regardless of what you choose here.</li>
    <li>Feature Option - If you mark the page as "Feature", it will display on the homepage of the website. The homepage is simply a list of "Featured" pages,</li>
    <li>Publish Option - If you unpublish the page, then that page and its menu item will not display on the site</li>
    <li>Page Access - Here you can control if the page and menu link will be viewable by everyone or only logged in users</li>
    <li>Page Title - This is different than the "Page Name". The page name is just the heading of the page. The "Page Title" 
        is a meta field used for SEO. It will also show in the browsers tab. You can choose a "global" page title in the settings area
    and leave this blank if preferred</li>
    <li>Meta Keywords & Description - These are also for SEO. Again, you can leave these blank and use the "global" SEO settings.</li>
    <li>Menu Options - This is important. If you do not choose a menu, the page will not be accessible on your site. Choose a menu, give it a title and choose the order position of the menu item
    You can see the "Current Page Order" under the order input field so you can see where you want to put the menu item for the page</li>
    
</ul>
